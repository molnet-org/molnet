Description: Analyze molecular data from stratified patient groups to predict a
    difference in drug response. Generate molecular networks for single molecule 
    types (e.g. proteins, mrna, metabolites, phosphoproteins) from raw data and 
    reduce them with significance testing or correlation thresholding.
    Combine these networks in individually different ways to an integrated
    molecular network.
    In a final analysis step, compute an interaction score for edges adjacent to
    drug targets in the combined network using a Python algorithm and derive a
    final differential drug response score between the stratified groups for any 
    list of drugs.
